======================
Q) Difference between list and tuple?
List is mutable,uses 2 memory blocks, slow compared to tuple 
and tuple is immutable, 1 memory block, faster and used for reading purpose

Q)what is set
set is immutable and does not store duplicate elements and follows hashing algorithm

Q)dict allows duplicate keys or not
keys should be unic and values can be duplicate

Q)if elements are even make them double else add 0
l = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,2,2,3,2,2,2,4,4]


print("List comprehension : ",[x*x if x%2 ==0 else 0 for x in l ])

Q)write a code for finding no. of times an element repeated in list

l = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,2,2,3,2,2,2,4,4]
def get_num_count(in_list):
    di = {}
    for val in in_list:
        if val not in di.keys():
            di[val] = 1
        else:
            di[val] += 1
    for val,count in di.items():
        print(val,"----",count)

get_num_count(l)
Q) find max occurance value of concurrent element
l = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,2,2,3,2,2,2,4,4]


def get_max_con_val(in_list):
    val = l[0]
    temp = []
    di = {}
    for ind in range(len(in_list)):
        if in_list[ind] == val:
            temp.append(in_list[ind])
        else:
            if in_list[ind] not in di.keys():
                di[in_list[ind-1]] = len(temp)
                temp = []
            else:
                get_dval = di[in_list[ind]]
                print("GET",get_dval,temp)
                if get_dval <= len(temp):
                    di[in_list[ind]] = temp
                    temp = []
    print(di)
get_max_con_val(l)
Q) what is Abstraction
Binding methods and its members in an single entity is called Abstraction
Q)what are the types of inheritance
single
multiple
multi level
hybrid
hyrarichal
# multiple inh..

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("A class")
    def m1(self):
        print("A m1() ")

class B:
    def __init__(self):
        print("B class")
    def m1(self):
        print("B m1() ")

class C(A,B):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
c = C()
c.m1()



Q) write a query to select max salary
empid
name
deptId
salary
Q)write a query using inner join to select dept id and max salary

deptId
deptName
select d1. deptid, d1.dname, max(sal)  from employee e1 inner join dept d1 on e1.deptid = d1.deptid
group by deptid

Q)difference between search and match in regular expressions
search - checks for a match anywhere in the string 
match - checks for a match only beginning of the string

Q)what is * and $ in regular expressions
* - 0 or many
$ - at the end

didnt use much actually
only in framewoks used for mapping

Q)used pandas?
no
numpy pandas didnt work

Q)what is abstraction
hiding  implementation details and expositng only method signature


so that we will provide abstriot for methods body



Q)how did you handled large amount of data

mostly it has 100 to 200 lines of data in file


used context manager using wiht managementer

with opne(filname) as file_obj:



Q) how to connect to database
using psycopg2 moduel conncetd to postgreql

and mysql used mysql connector for db connection

Q) how you used django
mvt architecu
used views lyaer to imp;lmente business lgogic

adnd atabase in settings.py file to cifigure db details

used model classes

Q) Django features
django has builtin orm mapping

mvt architecure

loosely cpupled nature aong model view and template layers


single app and multip

Q) signals used?
singals not usre
may be after deleting acitliy we can do post_Delete signal
