Q)Have you worked on flask?
flask i have wroked
and flask falsk=restful modules 

Q)what are the relational databases you used?
I have used relational databases like mysql, postgreslq
and also have good knowledge on mongodb 

Q)2 tables with primary key and foreigh key constraints,what will happen if we enter duplicate key 
so it should be present as primeary key 
it will give primary key violation 

Q)did you use views in django for database connections
views which are logical and will be created using existing tables 
i did not use the but i have idea 

for good perofmance we can use views in databse only 
 
views are logical strucutres 

Q)do you have knowledge on trigger
trigger konwedge is ther but didint work on them plsql part 
long back i have learned

Q)Do you have knowlede in writing sql queries using joins ?
join in sql yes 
inner join, self left, right join etc.
Q)code 1
Table_A: EMP_ID, DOJ
Table_B: EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, EMP_ADDRESS
  
  
  select a.emp_id, b.emp_name from table_A a inner join table_B b
  on a.emp_id = b.emp_id
  where doj > date
  
i have used inner join on both tables 
and used where cluase to filter by date

Q)django has inbuilt database sqlite right so did you use that?

didnt use it but we can configure in settings.py file about new database configuration details 
like mysql or prostersl
then will create models in model.py class and then will do make migrations and migrate activites

first on model classes if we do make migrations then will create migrations .py file with latest
versoin 
and then on migrate command it will inteact with database and stores the respecgive query 
i mena executes the query

Q)Can you implement that how you used models?

from django.db import models


class Employee(models.Model):
    emp_id = models.IntegerFiled(primary_key=True)
    ename = modesl.CharFiled(max_lenght=100, blank=False, null=False)
    city = modesl.CharFied()
    sal = models.FloatFiled()
this way we can configure model class with modesl.Model as super class 
so our class will behave as model through inheritance concept

Q)how to get particular employee id from employee table?
    Employee.ojbects.get(eid='100')
	
Q)how to get employee name?
    Employee.ojbects.filter(name='rama')

Q)what is the difference between get and filter methods
get for retrieving 1 record
filter for retrieving mutpile records 
get returns only one record and raise eception if doesnt exists
filter will give one or ore records and wont rase any excpetion 

Q)take 1 dictionary and how can we extract keys and values from it
dict1 = {'eid': 100, 'ename': 'Rama', 'sal': 10000, 'location': 'Bangalore'}

print("---------keys----------")
for key in dict1.keys():
    print(key)

print("---------values----------")

for val in dict1.values():
    print(val)
Q)How ?can we extract last inserted pair from dictionary
del_rec = dict1.popitem()
print(del_rec)

Q)how to use lambda function with map to double the numbers
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

print("Square of numbers:", list(map(lambda val: val ** 2, list1)))

Q)write a code to take 2 no.s as input and perform addition and substraction of them.
class ArithmeticOp:
    def __init__(self, num1, num2):
        self.num1 = num1
        self.num2 = num2

    def get_sum(self):
        res = self.num1 + self.num2
        print("Addition result ", res)

    def get_diff(self):
        res = self.num1 - self.num2
        print("Subtraction result :", res)


obj = ArithmeticOp(10, 20)
obj.get_sum()
obj.get_diff()


Q)what is the module we use for api calls
using requests moduel we can call get or post methods inside it

Q)what are the blocks available in exception handling
try expect else and finally blocks we can use 
Q)write a code to implement that 
def get_div_result(num1, num2):
  try:
    if num2 == 0:
      raise ZeroDivisionError("Den. should not be 0")
    res = num1/num2
    print("Division result ", res)
  except ZeroDivisionError as zde:
    print("Exception occured :", zde)
  else:
    print("If no exception occured")
  finally:
    print("Closing operaitons if any")

get_div_result(10, 0)


tech stack and domain of project would like to know

REQ:
-----
no idea now

this is my first interview after 2 years
so got tensed little bit
